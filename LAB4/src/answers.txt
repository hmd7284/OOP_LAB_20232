1.3. 
Question:
Programming with AWT and Swing is quite similar (similar elements including container/components, and 
event-handling). However, there are some differences that you need to note: 
o Compare the top-level containers in Swing and AWT 
o Compare the class name of components in AWT and the corresponding classâ€™s name in Swing 
o Compare the event-handling of Swing and AWT applications 
The resulting appearances of the applications developed using Swing and AWT might be different as well. 
Make comparisons.

Answer: Comparing AWT and Swing
- Top-level containers:
    + AWT: Include Frame, Dialog, and Window.
    + Swing: include JFrame, JDialog, and JWindow

- Class names of components:
    + AWT: Class names: Button, TextField, Label, List...
    + Swing: Class names similar to AWT but prefixed with 'J'

- Event handling:
    + AWT: Smaller set of event classes like ActionEvent, MouseEvent,... Uses listener interfaces like ActionListener, MouseListener... The components register their listeners using methods like addActionListener, addMouseListener, etc...
    + Swing: Wide range of event classes. Also uses listener interfaces for event handling but it provides additional convenience classes such as AbstractAction and Action for handling actions.

- Resulting appearances:
    + AWT: Varies based on the underlying platform
    + Swing: Consistent appearance across platforms
