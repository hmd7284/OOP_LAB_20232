Question:
- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title 
then create a constructor method to build
a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

Answer:
No, when we do this, Java will display a notification indicating that the method (constructor) 
has been duplicated, and will prevent the programm from running.
