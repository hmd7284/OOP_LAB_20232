14. Question:
- Which classes are aggregates of other classes?
Checking all constructors of whole classes if they initialize for their parts?
- Write constructors for parent and child classes. Remove redundant setter methods if any

Answer:

- Cart is aggregate of Media. Store is aggregate of Media. CompactDisc is aggregate of Track
- Implemented in code

15. Question:
When overriding the equals() method of the Object class, you will have to cast the Object
parameter obj to the type of Object that you are dealing with. For example, in the Media class,
you must cast the Object obj to a Media, and then check the equality of the two objectsâ€™ attributes
as the above requirements (i.e. title for Media; title and length for Track). If the
passing object is not an instance of Media, what happens?

Answer:

If the passed object is not an instance of Media, equals() will return false.
This imply that the 2 objects are not equal because they belong to different classes or incompatible types.

16. Reading assignment:
- What are the advantages of Polymorphism?
- How is Inheritance useful to achieve Polymorphism in Java?
- What are the differences between Polymorphism and Inheritance in Java?

Answer:

- Advantages of polymorphism:
    + Reusability: provides reusability for code, as methods with the same name can be used in different classes.
    + Complexity reduction: Reduce the complexity of code by allowing the use of the same method name for related functionality.
    + Simplified code: Reducing the number of constructors and method that need to be written.
    + Better Organization: Allows better code organization by grouping related functionality in one class.
    + Extensibility: New subclasses can be created to extend the functionality of the superclass without modifying existing code.

- Inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. Polymorphism uses those inherited methods to perform different tasks, allow us to perform action in different ways.

- Differences between Inheritance and Polymorphism:
+ Inheritance:
    --Inheritance is when a new class is created (derived class) that inherits the features of existing class (base class).
    --Applied to classes.
    --Supports the code reusability in OOP
    --Can be single, hybrid, multiple, hierarchical and multilevel inheritance.

+ Polymorphism:
    --Can be defined in multiple forms.
    --Applied to functions and methods.
    --Allows the object to decide which form of the function to implement at compile-time (overloading) or run-time (overriding).
